    <h1>From the Vineyard to the World</h1>

    <p>My name is Priscila Parente, and I am currently a student.</p>

    <p>This site is an initial project where I apply the knowledge I’m gaining through my course.</p>

    <p>As I dive deeper into the world of technology and web development, I wanted to combine two of my passions — wine and learning. This page was built to share a bit of who I am while practicing my skills.</p>

    <p>I aspire to create a small vineyard dedicated exclusively to producers, a place where professionals from around the world can come together to share experiences, refine techniques, and build lasting connections. More than just a business, it is a shared passion that unites us.</p>
